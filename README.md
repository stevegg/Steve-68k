# Steve's 68k

![Steve 68k](./Steve%2068k.png?raw=true "Steve 68k")

This is my extremely simple 68000 single board computer.  It has 512k of ROM and 512k of RAM.

## What's the Point?

I'm building this to learn the fundamentals of microprocessors and their use in computer systems.  Modern day computers are complex and require specific supporting chip sets.  These retro processors were simple and much easier to understand but in the end the principles are the same.


This design **HEAVILLY** borrows from [Neil Klingensmith](https://neilklingensmith.com/teaching/68khomebrew/) whose explanations really helped me grasp some of the fundamentals.
